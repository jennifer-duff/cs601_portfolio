            <p>Hi! I'm Jennifer. I'm a full-stack software engineer based out of Seattle, Washington. I graduated from Pepperdine University in 2017 with a degree in Biology. Shortly thereafter, I discovered a love of programming and have since graduated with a BS in Software Development. I'm now pursuing my Masters of Software Development at Boston University.</p>
            <p>Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Lightcast. My job is full-stack development of a web application used to display labor market analytics. I work primarily with PHP on the backend, JavaScript/React on the frontend, and SQL for our database. In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games with my husband, hanging with my cat, and skiing. I'm looking forward to working with you!</p>
