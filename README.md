# JBD Development - Portfolio Site

## Assignment 1

This site is a portfolio designed to display my development skills. It uses many HTML5 semantic elements, including:

- `section`
- `article`
- `img`
- `video`
- `table`
- Headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.)
- `ul` and `li`
- Anchor tags (`a`)
- `header`
- `footer`
- `nav`
- Paragraphs (`p`)

2 paragraphs of text-based content can be found on the "About" page.

Links to my GitHub are provided on the "Portfolio" and "Contact" pages. The "Contact" page also includes a link to my LinkedIn profile.

Tabular data is displayed on the "Contact" page.

A list is used on the "Resume" page.

A video is embedded on the "About" page.

## Assignment 2
The site is styled with CSS contained in `styles.css`.

There are 3 media queries at the bottom of `styles.css` - one for a `max-width` of `1490px`, one for `850px`, and one for `675px`.

Many different elements are styled, including:
- The `body`
- The `main` section
- Headings
- Anchor tags
- The `header`, including the `nav` and its subelements
- Unordered lists and their list elements
- The `footer`
- All images
- Tables
- Elements that are unique to the individual pages:
    - Each `section` on the "Portfolio" page
    - The video on the "About" page
    - The `.resume-wrapper` on the "Resume" page
    - The graphic elements on the "Home" page
    - And more!

Styling has been applied to many different properties, including:
- font-related properties (e.g., `font-weight`, `font-size`, etc.)
- `display` (`flex` is used extensively - for example, see the `body` or the `header`)
- `transition` (for example, see the logo in the header)
- `margin` and `padding`
- `text-decoration`
- `background-color` and `color`
- `box-shadow`
- `border`
- `width` and `height`
