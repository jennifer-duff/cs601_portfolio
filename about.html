                        Hello, world! My name is Jennifer; I'm a full-stack software engineer based out of Seattle,
                        Washington. I graduated from Pepperdine University in 2017 with a degree in Biology. Shortly
                        thereafter, I discovered a love of programming and have since graduated with a BS in Software
                        Development. I'm now pursuing my Masters of Software Development at Boston University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Lightcast. My job is full-stack development of a web
                        application used to display labor market analytics. I work primarily with PHP on the backend,
                        JavaScript/React on the frontend, and SQL for our database. In my spare time, I enjoy playing
                        video games with my husband, hanging with my cat, and skiing. I'm looking forward to working
                        with you!
                    </p>
